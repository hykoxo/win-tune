## System

### AtlasOS
I use AtlasOS to make Windows more performant, usable, and privacy-friendly. You can download it [here](https://atlasos.net/).

### Windows Manager
I use FancyZones from [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) to manage windows.

1. Download PowerToys from the releases page.
2. Install PowerToys.
3. Open PowerToys and go to FancyZones.
4. Create a custom layout and apply it.

* With that when I drag a window and click on Shift, I can snap it to the zones.

### Windhawk
I use Windhawk to customize Windows. You can download it [here](https://windhawk.net/).

Here is the list of mods I use:
- windows-11-start-menu-styler
- disable-rounded-corners

## Style

### Taskbar
I use TranslucentTB to make the taskbar transparent. You can download it [here](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB).

### Wallpaper
I use Wallpaper Engine to set a live wallpaper. You can download it [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/).

Here is the wallpaper on the screenshot: [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2181619161](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2181619161)

### Custom apps icons
I use custom icons for some apps.

Simply replace the icon in the properties of the app.

### Custom cursor
Sometimes I use a custom cursor from [this](https://github.com/antiden/macOS-cursors-for-Windows) repository.

1. Download the repository.
2. Install with Install.inf. (Right-click on Install.inf and click Install)
3. Go to Settings > Devices > Mouse > Additional mouse options > Pointers > Browse and select the cursor you want.

I use the one with the shadow.
